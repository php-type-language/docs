# @psalm-ignore-var

<primary-label ref="phpdoc-component"/>
<secondary-label ref="not-implemented"/>

The `@psalm-ignore-var` tag excludes the `@var` annotation immediately
following it from being used by Psalm for type inference, telling the
analyzer to fall back to its own inferred type instead of trusting the
declared one.

Not yet recognized by <code>TypeLang\PhpDoc\DocBlockParser</code> — parsing
a docblock containing this tag returns a plain <code>Tag</code>, its whole
suffix folded into the description. See
<a href="custom-tags.md">Custom Tags</a> for the current workaround if you
need to recognize it yourself.
